# Predicting Capital Bikeshare demands

This project was completed in week 3 of the Data Science Bootcamp at Spiced Academy.
The goal is to predict how many rental bikes are needed at a certain time, based on information about weather conditions and daily patterns.

## Dataset
The dataset used is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand/submissions).

## Descriptive analysis
- [Explorative Data Analysis](https://github.com/lorenanda/bike-demand-prediction/blob/main/project03_eda.ipynb)
- *Tools*: pandas, datetime, seaborn, matplotlib 

## Regression models
- Linear Regression (R²: 0.66)
- Random Forest Regressors (RMSLE score: 0.47 / 0.49 in the Kaggle competition)
- *Tools*: scikitlearn, GridSearchCV, TPOT
